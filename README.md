Approximation of 1D continous functions by sigmoid superpositions, by BK Pradhan, CDS, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

Based on the paper "Cybenko, George. "Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function." Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems (MCSS) 2.4 (1989): 303-314."

Uses adaptive learning rate. 

Code is tentative, any suggestions welcome.
